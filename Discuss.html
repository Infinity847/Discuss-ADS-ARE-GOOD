    <h1 style = "font-variant:small-caps;color:blue;">Advertising is good!</h1>
    <p style = "color:blue"> The reason why advertising is good is that you get money for putting these adds in.<br> These ads help people make money. But the amount of money you get for ads is a cent. Its not funny when people say no to advertising.<br>
    The best thing to do when someone says no to advertising is to tell them to think about why ads.<br> If you say no ads you are like a person who says no money on paypal account! Please dont be that person who says no ads.<br> Be a good person by saying that ads are good because of the money and atraction!
